- 👋 Hi, I’m @King-Shady
- 👀 I’m interested in all things tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python as an intro to coding and i plan on adding other languages later: full stack is the goal, right...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything basically as i'm still a noob. This is literally my first dip into code.
